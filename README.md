# Hey there! 👋

I'm George, a student at Amrita School of Engineering in Bangalore, where I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

I'm passionate about deep learning and building projects that make a real-world impact. Whether I'm working on improving healthcare systems with smart scheduling or diving into speech models, I enjoy solving complex problems through code.

🔭 **What I'm working on right now:**  
- 🧠 A Convolution-Enhanced Speech Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition (using the LJSpeech dataset)  
- 🏥 A machine learning-based patient scheduling system for emergency rooms that helps optimize wait times  

🌱 **What I'm learning at the moment:**  
- TensorFlow and PyTorch optimization techniques to fine-tune models  
- Docker and multi-environment development for cleaner workflows  
- Advanced speech processing methods, including attention mechanisms like CBAM and self-attention, and working with autoencoders

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about any of this or just connect!
